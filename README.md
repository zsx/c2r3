# c2r3
A tool to help wrap C functions in Rebol 3

This tool is based on libclang, which is part of LLVM (http://llvm.org/). 
It uses libclang to parse the C files and traverse the AST, and generates
Rebol 3 bindings for enum, struct! and functions.

As libclang is a C library, it needs a Rebol 3 binding to be used in this
tool, and the binding is generated by this tool itself. So it bootstraps.

It's designed more as a library than an application. So the user is anticipated
to do some scripting to generate the binding.

Directory hierarchy:
---- lib: main library
  \- tools: some binding generation tools (including clang binding generator)
  \- bindings: some pre-generated bindings
